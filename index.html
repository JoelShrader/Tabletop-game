                <p><b>Before rushing headlong into character creation</b>, take time to familiarize yourself with <a href="/Current Events">modern life</a> and <a href="/History">what led to it</a> in the setting. As a homebrew of my own design it's got its own quirks, opportunities, and restrictions. You should also familiarize yourself with <a href="/Ruleset">OVA Revized</a> to get an idea of what you're expected to come up with. As the setting features a wide variety of options for <a href="/Races">what to play</a>, the list of options will be non-exhaustive. Like the ruleset, it's pretty open ended. If you can justify to me why you should be able to play it, I'll most likely let you do so.</p>

                <p>If you aren't sure if an idea works, or want help making something fit, or simply want to brainstorm, contact me via <a href="joel@somethingorother.com">email</a> or on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. Make sure you are set up with a <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> account at some point before game time. I will distribute a game link via Discord when it is set up.</p>
